%% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@@plot79.math.utah.edu>

I've modified the top-level makefile for hoc to include GNU standard
targets, added a configure script, and unpacked the tests.a archive
into a subdirectory, tests, and supplied it with a makefile and a
subsubdirectory, okay, with correct output, and augmented the test
suite with the file gamma (because of new code added to math.c to
support that function on NeXT systems).

In hoc.y, I had to move one variable declaration (for indef) to the
top section, to avoid compilation failure on IBM RS/6000 AIX 4.1.

I also fixed some non-portable constructions in the manual page file,
hoc.1.

All changes are under RCS control.

Now, the usual GNU incantation

	./configure
	make all check install

will work on most UNIX systems.

On older UNIX systems, you need to use a Standard C compiler, such as
gcc or c89, if cc is only at the K&R level, e.g.

	./configure && make CC=lcc all check install

This package has been successfully installed at this author's site on
these systems:

DEC Alpha		OSF/1 3.2
DECstation 5000		ULTRIX 4.3
HP 9000/735		HP-UX 10.01
IBM PowerPC		AIX 4.1
NeXT Turbostation	Mach 3.3
SGI Indigo/2		IRIX 5.3
SGI O2 R10000-SC	IRIX 6.3
SGI Origin 200		IRIX 6.4
Sun SPARC		Solaris 2.5
Sun SPARC		SunOS 4.1.3

Under IRIX 6.4, some of the tests failed at optimization levels -g,
-O, -O1, and -O2 with both cc and c89, so I switched to gcc, which
produced correct test output.
