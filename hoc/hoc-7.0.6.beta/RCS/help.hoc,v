### /usr/local/src/hoc/hoc-7.0.1.beta/help.hoc, Fri Jan 11 07:35:41 2002
### Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@@math.utah.edu>

### ====================================================================
### NB: Each help function below must output either a horizontal rule,
### or a final empty line, or else call another help_xxx() function,
### which will supply that empty line.  This ensures uniform appearance
### and better readability of the output of help_all().
###
### Unless it is a major sectional heading, help text must start with at
### least one tab character, and no help line should be longer than 80
### characters, after tab expansion (i.e., filling with spaces through
### the next column that is a multiple of 8, counting from 1).
###
### The functions should be ordered alphabetically, unless they call
### other functions, in which case they must come AFTER the called
### functions (because hoc requires definition-before-reference).
###
### To improve readability, empty lines in output documentation should
### be produced by \n\n in a print statement, and that statement should
### itself be followed by an empty line in the procedure body.

Correct body of help_now(): it was obsolete.

Add 67 new help_xxx() procedures after comparing the output of
who("*") with a list of existing help procedures.  All hoc built-in
variables are now documented.

Put match description in private internal procedure ___help_match().

Add help_matula().
